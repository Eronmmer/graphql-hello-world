# Learning GraphQL

### [GraphQL Schema Language Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/sogko/graphql-schema-language-cheat-sheet)

## Stuff...

- A `!` indicates that a field cannot be null.
- graphql will cast any value passed to what it expects as specified in the type definitions.
- `Query` is for stuff you can read. Think of `GET` in rest apis. A `Mutation` on the other hand acts like a PUT, POST & DELETE requests.
- Resolvers can also be asynchronous & return promises
